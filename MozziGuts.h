/*! @defgroup core Mozzi Core Functions

@ingroup core
Sets up the timers for audio and control rate processes, storing the timer
registers so they can be restored when Mozzi stops. startMozzi() goes in your sketch's
setup() routine.

This function intializes the timer(s) needed to move audio samples to the output according to the
configured @ref MOZZI_AUDIO_MODE .

@param control_rate_hz Sets how often updateControl() is called.  It must be a power of 2.
If no parameter is provided, control_rate_hz is set to MOZZI_CONTROL_RATE,
which has a default value of 64 (you can re-\#define it in your sketch).
The practical upper limit for control rate depends on how busy the processor is,
and you might need to do some tests to find the best setting.

@note startMozzi calls setupMozziADC(), which calls setupFastAnalogRead() and adcDisconnectAllDigitalIns(),
which disables digital inputs on all analog input pins.  All in mozzi_analog.h and easy to change if you need to (hack).
They are all called automatically and hidden away because it keeps things simple for a STANDARD_PLUS set up,
but if it turns out to be confusing, they might need to become visible again.
*/
void startMozzi(int control_rate_hz = MOZZI_CONTROL_RATE);



/** @ingroup core
Stops audio and control interrupts and restores the timers to the values they
had before Mozzi was started. This could be useful when using sensor libraries
which depend on the same timers as Mozzi.

A potentially better option for resolving timer conflicts involves using
non-blocking methods, such as demonstrated by the twowire_nonblock code in the
forked version of Mozzi on github, so sound production can continue while
reading sensors.

As it is, stopMozzi restores all the Timers used by Mozzi to their previous
settings. Another scenario which could be easily hacked in MozziGuts.hpp could
involve individually saving and restoring particular Timer registers depending
on which one(s) are required for other tasks.

@note This function is not actually implemented on all platforms.

This is required in Arduino's loop(). If there is room in Mozzi's output buffer,

buffer.  Also, if \@ref MOZZI_AUDIO_INPUT is enabled in the config,
audioHook() takes care of moving audio input from the input buffer so it can be
accessed with getAudioInput() in your updateAudio() routine.
If other functions are called in loop() along with audioHook(), see if
they can be called less often by moving them into updateControl(),
to save processing power. Otherwise it may be most efficient to
calculate a block of samples at a time by putting audioHook() in a loop of its
own, rather than calculating only 1 sample for each time your other functions
are called.
