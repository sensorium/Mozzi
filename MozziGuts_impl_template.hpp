/** README! 
 * This file is meant to be used as a template when adding support for a new platform. Please read these instructions, first.
 *
 *  Files involved:
 *  1. Modify hardware_defines.h, adding a macro to detect your target platform
 *  2. Modify MozziGuts.cpp to include MozziGuts_impl_YOURPLATFORM.hpp
 *  3. Modify MozziGuts.h to include AudioConfigYOURPLATFORM.h
 *  4. Copy this file to MozziGuts_impl_YOURPLATFORM.hpp and adjust as necessary
 *  (If your platform is very similar to an existing port, it may instead be better to modify the existing MozziGuts_impl_XYZ.hpp/AudioConfigYOURPLATFORM.h,
 *  instead of steps 2-3.).
 *  Some platforms may need small modifications to other files as well, e.g. mozzi_pgmspace.h
 *
 *  How to implement MozziGuts_impl_YOURPLATFORM.hpp:
 *  - Follow the NOTEs provided in this file
 *  - Read the doc at the top of AudioOutput.h for a better understanding of the basic audio output framework
 *  - Take a peek at existing implementations for other hardware (e.g. TEENSY3/4 is rather complete while also simple at the time of this writing)
 *  - Wait for more documentation to arrive
 *  - Ask when in doubt
 *  - Don't forget to provide a PR when done (it does not have to be perfect; e.g. many ports skip analog input, initially)

/** NOTE: This section deals with implementing (fast) asynchronous analog reads, which form the backbone of mozziAnalogRead(), but also of MOZZI_AUDIO_INPUT (if enabled).
 *
 * It is possible, and even recommended, to skip over this section, initially, when starting a new port. Once you have an implementation, be sure to include something like this
 * in your platform configuration checks:
 *
 * // analog reads shall be enabled by default on platforms that support it 
 * #if not defined(MOZZI_ANALOG_READ)
 * #define MOZZI_ANALOG_READ MOZZI_ANALOG_READ_STANDARD
 * #endif
 *
 * The only function in this section that is always defined is setupFastAnalogRead() (but this, too, may be left empty, initially).

/** NOTE: On "pins" vs. "channels" vs. "indices"
 *  "Pin" is the pin number as would usually be specified by the user in mozziAnalogRead().
 *  "Channel" is an internal ADC channel number corresponding to that pin. On many platforms this is simply the same as the pin number, on others it differs.
 *      In other words, this is an internal representation of "pin".
 *  "Index" is the index of the reading for a certain pin/channel in the array of analog_readings, ranging from 0 to NUM_ANALOG_PINS. This, again may be the
 *      same as "channel" (e.g. on AVR), however, on platforms where ADC-capable "channels" are not numbered sequentially starting from 0, the channel needs
 *      to be converted to a suitable index.
 *
 *  In summary, the semantics are roughly
 *      mozziAnalogRead(pin) -> _ADCimplementation_(channel) -> analog_readings[index]
 *  Implement adcPinToChannelNum() and channelNumToIndex() to perform the appropriate mapping.
