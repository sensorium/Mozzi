Mozzi sound synthesis library for Arduino

NEWS


Version 0.01.1n

- EventDelay() 
	- IMPORTANT! this will break old sketches.
	
	  Constructor syntax changed from:

		EventDelay MyEventDelay(UPDATE_RATE);
		to 
		EventDelay <UPDATE_RATE> MyEventDelay();
		
	- added start(unsigned int delay_milliseconds), sets and starts the delay in one go.
		
- _03c_AMSynth - more detailed, and far more irritating example.
- hack for Teensy 2 (32u4), pasted from hardware/arduino/variants/leonardo/pins_arduino.h (actually included in previous version)
- Sample - fixed bug where phase was incremented even if looping was off and the sample was past the loop point, which caused
	unintentional looping when phase wrapped.
- example _07_Control_Oscil_Wash - modified volume controls to range 0-255 instead of centred around 0, tinkered with frequencies.
- example _08_Detuned_Beats_Wash changed xorshift stuff to rand.
- AudioDelay() - added option to set delaytime_cells in constructor.
- AudioDelayFeedback() - added options to set delaytime_cells and feedback_level in constructor.
- added prime number generator in "primes.h", inspired by Inspired by PrimeSieve by Paul Badger 2009 http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/PrimeSieve
- Line() - fixed some bugs by using ATOMIC_BLOCK and volatile for a variable which could be changed in different interrupts within a sketch.



Version 0.01.1m

- Oscil - fixed inaccurate results for small table sizes in setFreq().
- Removed EventDelay.cpp, EventDelay() is all in the .h file so all inline now.
- Moved all sample tables into "samples" folder, now in top level Mozzi folder.
- Added example _18b_Waveshaper_Difference_Tone.
- Removed examples_recordings folder, each example has its recordings inside in the folder with the example sketch.
- Wrote an automated build and record script to check all examples work for each release.
- Line - fixed a bug which caused incorrect step calculation for unsigned types.
- _03_Control_Tremelo example - added audio-rate linear interpolation to amplitude-control.
- Smooth - increased internal smoothness resolution from Q0n8 to Q0n16 for template parameter types larger than char.
- _05_Smooth example - changed to do smoothing in updateAudio().
- Various examples slightly modified/fixed (more needs doing).
	

Version 0.01.1l

- fixed randSeed() and xorshift96Seed();
- Sample()
	- added looping parameters
	- changed the internals of next - slower at 4us but more flexible
	- now wave tables can be arbitrary lengths, no more power-of-2 restriction
	- added example _11b_Sample_Loop_Points
- Phasor is now set to output only unsigned longs.  Fixed bad bugs.
- Add example _19_PWM_Phasing, demonstrating Phasor() as an audio generator.


Version 0.01.1k

- Tested and working on Leonardo board.


Version 0.01.1j

- Fixed Phasor and docs.


Version 0.01.1i

- newer version of TimerOne library from http://www.pjrc.com.  Teensy2++ works,
	Arduino Mega and others should also be OK, noting audio out pin differences in README Quick Start section.
- added option for dithering oscillator phase, which can reduce spurious frequencies.  Add it like this:
	#define DITHER_OSCIL_PHASE
	#include <oscil.h>
- added Phasor.h, a high resolution repeating ramp generator, much better for some synth calculations
	than using an 8-bit saw wave oscil.
- lots of typos, etc.


Version 0.01.1h

- more Leonardo/Teensy compatibilty fixes, thanks to massi on mozzi users list.


Version 0.01.1g

- changed control interrupts to Timer0 to test compatibility on atmega32u4 - (Leonardo/Teensy).
	Timer0 is used by Arduino IDE, but Mozzi clobbered it already,
	has EventDelay() to replace delay(), and this now leaves Timer2
	(Timer4 on atmega32u4) free.
- replaced: prog_char with: const char __attribute__((progmem))
	to test compatibility with atmega32u4 (Leonardo/Teeny).
	Changed tables and python scripts to match.
- added example _12c_Samples_Tables_Arrays, showing a way to use
	Samples and sound tables in arrays, and using a small number of Sample players
	to play many sound tables.


Version 0.01.1f

- added WaveShaper(), a table-based waveshaping object suited for audio synthesis,
	with an example sketch,  _18_WaveShaper.
- added tables for use with WaveShaper(), including Chebyshev polynomial curves and sigmoid curves.
- utils.h: added rand(), a fast ranged random number generator using xorshift96(),
	for signed and unsigned chars and ints, in rand(min,max) for values
	between min and max-1, and rand(max) for 0 to max-1.
	Much easier to use than xorshift() on its own.
- added a folder of bamboo percussion sample tables - is it possible
	to get clean sounding samples at 8-bit 16384Hz resolution?
	Looking at old Amiga sample archives for hints.
- added _16b_LowPassFilter_AnalogRead_Control example
- lots of typos


Version 0.01.1e

- added LowPass1stOrder.h, an alternative to Smooth which can handle long numbers.
- fixed a bug in Smooth.h which stopped high smoothness values working properly.
- added another example for Smooth, changing freqency.
- fixed errors in fixedMath.h
- fixed a naming problem in char2mozzi.py
- added _02b_FMsynth example
- added _03b_AMsynth example
- added _05b_Smooth2 example
- added _05c_LowPass1stOrder example


Version 0.01.1d

-utils.h: added startAnalogRead() and receiveAnalogRead(), so conversion can
	happen in the background instead of hogging the cpu in Arduino's analogRead().
- fixedMath.h: tweaks and additions


Version 0.01.1c

- Smooth.h: increased speed from about 400 us to between 1-5 us, depending on
number type, by changing floating to fixed point in internal calculations. Types
are now restricted to char, unsigned char, int and unsigned int.
- fixedMath.h: changed *_float2fix names to float_to* , added some types and fixed some mistakes
- utils.h:
	-hardcoded midiToFreq[] array to progmem instead of generating on startup
	-removed old Q16n16_mtof() and renamed Q16n16_mtofLookup() to Q16n16_mtof().
	The old Q16n16_mtof() was slower and less accurate than the lookup version.
- fixed example _08_Detuned_Beats_Wash to work with new midi, fixed-point and Oscil setFreq_Q16n16 code.


Version 0.01.1b

- Oscil.h:
	- added a setPhase() method to play a table from any position.
	- added setFreq_Q16n16() for setting frequency using Q16n16 fixed-point numbers
- _09_PhaseMod_Envelope example wasn't showing up in Arduino, fixed the name so it can be found.
- added triangle, saw and cos tables in sizes 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192
- added a float2mozzi_uint8.py, renamed the other wave converter scripts and made them more uniform
- utils.h/utils.cpp:
	- added Q16n16_mtofLookup(), a fast (but less accurate for non-integer midi note numbers) fixed point alternative to mtof().
	- added Q16n16_mtof(), a faster (but less accurate overall) fixed point alternative to mtof().
	- changed setupFastADC() to setupFastAnalogRead()
- replaced TABLE_NUM_CELLS with NUM_CELLS in tables


Version 0.01.1

- Changed utils.c to utils.cpp and changed all examples from #include utils.c to #include utils.h.
- Changed and capitalised names in saw_analogue512_int8.h
- Removed some wavetables which were too short. (should make more 1024 & 2048 tables)
- Oscil.h and Sample.h, added a constructor for declaring without a table, and a setTable() method, prompted by "konsumer' on mozzi-users
