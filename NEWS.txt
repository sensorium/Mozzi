Mozzi sound synthesis library for Arduino

NEWS


Version 0.01.1v
- Introduced alternative output options, STANDARD and HIFI.  STANDARD is set by default and is the
	original Mozzi output, 16384Hz, nearly 9 bit PWM on pin 9.  
	HIFI is 16384Hz, 14 bits and has a high PWM carrier frequency of 125kHz which
	puts it out of hearing range, addressing an issue where some people have
	problems with a high pitched whine from the original 16kHz carrier frequency.
	HIFI is a big improvement in the sound quality. The cost is that it uses an
	extra timer (Timer2) and uses 2 output pins, 2 resistors and a capacitor to hear
	the output, where STANDARD mode is ready to go without any external parts 
	(but can need filters which are more complicated than the HIFI parts).
	For HIFI sketches, you probably want to adjust the output from your 
	updateAudio() functions to use the full 14 bits of resolution.
	Check the documentation of the Mozzi core module for hardware set-up and more detail.
- Fixed mtof() so midi note 0 now returns a frequency of 0.
- AudioDelayFeedback() now runs 4.5 times faster, taking 4us instead of 18us per sample.
- LowPassFilter()'s performance is improved from 14us to 10.5us per sample.
- Made LowPassFilter and AudioDelayFeedback examples more sane, with comments.
- Added LowPassFilter_X_2 and AudioDelayFeedback_X_2 examples with 2 each of these 
	units running together.
- Renamed fixedMath.h and fixedMath.cpp to mozzi_fixmath.h and mozzi_fixmath.cpp.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Renumbered all the examples.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Renumbered all the examples.  Sorry for the inconvenience.



Version 0.01.1u
- moved audio Timer 1 ISR to MozziGuts.cpp, so outputAudio() can be inlined, saving about 16ms/s (1.6%, not much!)
- mozzi_utils.h rewrote macros as inline functions, now setPin13Out(), setPin13Low() and setPin13High().  That'll break a few sketches!
- Oscil.h - fixed bug which stopped OSCIL_DITHER_PHASE option finding xorshift96().
- fixed some broken links on the github wiki.
- removed LowPass1stOrder.h - it provided linear interpolation which can be done better with Line().
- removed examples/m_09_LowPass1stOrder


Version 0.01.1t
- Added Portamento.h, in response to ajax on mozzi-users - easier to make a new unit than to do it in a sketch.
- Added example m_34_Teensy_USB_MIDI_portamento.
- Removed MozziTimer2.cpp and MozziTimer2.h, they're not used.  Removed commented references to them in MozziGuts.cpp and MozziGuts.h.
- Removed the commented out references to FrequencyTimer2.cpp and FrequencyTimer2.h in MozziGuts.cpp and MozziGuts.h.
- Online documentation was long out of date, now up to date (I forgot I had to do it manually).  Why can't github follow symlinks?
- Oscil.h - added getPhaseFractional() and setPhaseFractional() for experiments with using addition of out-of-phase oscils to adjust gain instead of using multiplies.
- mozzi_fixmath.h - rewrote #define types as typedefs and conversion macros as inline functions containing static_cast for better compile-time error checking.
- Smooth.h - added a template for floats.  Aah that feels better.


Version 0.01.1s
- Added randSeed() with no parameters, which seeds the random generator with 
	noise from reading the Arduino's internal temperature.  This randSeed() leaves analogReference() set to DEFAULT.
	Watch out for that.
- Modified examples m_10_Line_Gliss and m_11_Line_Gliss_Double to be easier to read, with more comments.
- Added experimental compatibility for ATmega644P based boards (gizduino, sanguino), waiting for (anyone?) testers to report.



Version 0.01.1r
- Fixed example m_26_getSensor_LowPassFilter, user Doctroid noticed a mistake in the circuit pinout.



Version 0.01.1q
- Added ADSR.h, a simple envelope generator, and an example m_32_ADSR_Envelope.
- Added m_33_Teensy_USB_MIDI_Input example, playing ADSR enveloped notes from a midi source.



Version 0.01.1p

- Moved midi, random and analog input code from utils each into their own files as described below.  
	THIS WILL BREAK OLD SKETCHES but is easy to fix by #including the appropriate new *.h files.
- Introduced mozzi_analog.h and mozzi_analog.cpp for new asynchronous analog input functions, much better than the old way.
	- Inserted example m_26_getSensor_LowPassFilter to show the new way of reading analog inputs, bumped numbers of 
		other examples to make room.
	- Moved old analog stuff to from utils to the new files.
	- Renamed setAnalogInChannel() and unSetAnalogInChannel() to disconnectDigitalIn() and reconnectDigitalIn().  Can't 
		tell if disconnectDigitalIn() really makes any difference to analog readings despite the rationale of reducing noise.
- Moved random number generator functions from utils to mozzi_rand.h and mozzi_rand.cpp, adjusted examples.
- Moved midi note-to-frequency conversion functions to mozzi_midi.h and mozzi.midi.cpp.
- Fixed a show-stopping typo in StateVariable.



Version 0.01.1o

- Mega2650 boards should now work properly.  Stephen Scutt identified a bug at upload time,
	if the compiler sees 3 !!! exclamation marks in a row (or 33, 33, 33 in decimal) 
	it enters serial mode and the board freezes.  All tables now have occurrences of 33, 33, 33 dithered.
- python/char2mozzi.py, the python script for converting raw data to sound tables now
	changes every 3rd 33 in a row to 32 or 34 (random).
- Examples are renamed, so they are now prefixed with m_##_, eg. m_01_Sinewave, and given a sequential 
	numerical order without the "a", "b" etc.  The renaming has to do with a script for a generating web
	page for the code and audio recordings of sketches.
- Ead.h - added function, start(unsigned int attack_ms, unsigned int decay_ms), to set and start a new envelope.
		Changed from switch..case to if..else for checking envelope phase in next().
- Example m_24_Ead_Envelope updated to generate random envelopes, to demonstrate variations.
- Added StateVariable.h, a resonant audio filter with lowpass, bandpass, highpass and notch modes.  This works well.
- m_30_StateVariable_Filter example added.
- removed fastSqrt.h - it's about 25 times slower than avr-lib sqrt()!  Hat tip to the oscilloscope.
- mozzi_utils.h - added setAnalogInChannel(), which disables digital input for a selected analog input pin, 
		improving noise and speed.  Also added unSetAnalogInChannel(), to reconnect digital input. 


Version 0.01.1n

- EventDelay() 
	- IMPORTANT! this will break old sketches.
	
	  Constructor syntax changed from:

		EventDelay MyEventDelay(UPDATE_RATE);
		to 
		EventDelay <UPDATE_RATE> MyEventDelay();
		
	- added start(unsigned int delay_milliseconds), sets and starts the delay in one go.
		
- _03c_AMSynth - more detailed, and far more irritating example.
- hack for Teensy 2 (32u4), pasted from hardware/arduino/variants/leonardo/pins_arduino.h (actually included in previous version)
- Sample - fixed bug where phase was incremented even if looping was off and the sample was past the loop point, which caused
	unintentional looping when phase wrapped.
- example _07_Control_Oscil_Wash - modified volume controls to range 0-255 instead of centred around 0, tinkered with frequencies.
- example _08_Detuned_Beats_Wash changed xorshift stuff to rand.
- AudioDelay() - added option to set delaytime_cells in constructor.
- AudioDelayFeedback() - added options to set delaytime_cells and feedback_level in constructor.
- added prime number generator in "primes.h", inspired by Inspired by PrimeSieve by Paul Badger 2009 http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/PrimeSieve
- Line() - fixed some bugs by using ATOMIC_BLOCK and volatile for a variable which could be changed in different interrupts within a sketch.



Version 0.01.1m

- Oscil - fixed inaccurate results for small table sizes in setFreq().
- Removed EventDelay.cpp, EventDelay() is all in the .h file so all inline now.
- Moved all sample tables into "samples" folder, now in top level Mozzi folder.
- Added example _18b_Waveshaper_Difference_Tone.
- Removed examples_recordings folder, each example has its recordings inside in the folder with the example sketch.
- Wrote an automated build and record script to check all examples work for each release.
- Line - fixed a bug which caused incorrect step calculation for unsigned types.
- _03_Control_Tremelo example - added audio-rate linear interpolation to amplitude-control.
- Smooth - increased internal smoothness resolution from Q0n8 to Q0n16 for template parameter types larger than char.
- _05_Smooth example - changed to do smoothing in updateAudio().
- Various examples slightly modified/fixed (more needs doing).
	

Version 0.01.1l

- fixed randSeed() and xorshift96Seed();
- Sample()
	- added looping parameters
	- changed the internals of next - slower at 4us but more flexible
	- now wave tables can be arbitrary lengths, no more power-of-2 restriction
	- added example _11b_Sample_Loop_Points
- Phasor is now set to output only unsigned longs.  Fixed bad bugs.
- Add example _19_PWM_Phasing, demonstrating Phasor() as an audio generator.


Version 0.01.1k

- Tested and working on Leonardo board.


Version 0.01.1j

- Fixed Phasor and docs.


Version 0.01.1i

- newer version of TimerOne library from http://www.pjrc.com.  Teensy2++ works,
	Arduino Mega and others should also be OK, noting audio out pin differences in README Quick Start section.
- added option for dithering oscillator phase, which can reduce spurious frequencies.  Add it like this:
	#define DITHER_OSCIL_PHASE
	#include <oscil.h>
- added Phasor.h, a high resolution repeating ramp generator, much better for some synth calculations
	than using an 8-bit saw wave oscil.
- lots of typos, etc.


Version 0.01.1h

- more Leonardo/Teensy compatibilty fixes, thanks to massi on mozzi users list.


Version 0.01.1g

- changed control interrupts to Timer0 to test compatibility on atmega32u4 - (Leonardo/Teensy).
	Timer0 is used by Arduino IDE, but Mozzi clobbered it already,
	has EventDelay() to replace delay(), and this now leaves Timer2
	(Timer4 on atmega32u4) free.
- replaced: prog_char with: const char __attribute__((progmem))
	to test compatibility with atmega32u4 (Leonardo/Teeny).
	Changed tables and python scripts to match.
- added example _12c_Samples_Tables_Arrays, showing a way to use
	Samples and sound tables in arrays, and using a small number of Sample players
	to play many sound tables.


Version 0.01.1f

- added WaveShaper(), a table-based waveshaping object suited for audio synthesis,
	with an example sketch,  _18_WaveShaper.
- added tables for use with WaveShaper(), including Chebyshev polynomial curves and sigmoid curves.
- mozzi_utils.h: added rand(), a fast ranged random number generator using xorshift96(),
	for signed and unsigned chars and ints, in rand(min,max) for values
	between min and max-1, and rand(max) for 0 to max-1.
	Much easier to use than xorshift() on its own.
- added a folder of bamboo percussion sample tables - is it possible
	to get clean sounding samples at 8-bit 16384Hz resolution?
	Looking at old Amiga sample archives for hints.
- added _16b_LowPassFilter_AnalogRead_Control example
- lots of typos


Version 0.01.1e

- added LowPass1stOrder.h, an alternative to Smooth which can handle long numbers.
- fixed a bug in Smooth.h which stopped high smoothness values working properly.
- added another example for Smooth, changing freqency.
- fixed errors in mozzi_fixmath.h
- fixed a naming problem in char2mozzi.py
- added _02b_FMsynth example
- added _03b_AMsynth example
- added _05b_Smooth2 example
- added _05c_LowPass1stOrder example


Version 0.01.1d

-mozzi_utils.h: added startAnalogRead() and receiveAnalogRead(), so conversion can
	happen in the background instead of hogging the cpu in Arduino's analogRead().
- mozzi_fixmath.h: tweaks and additions


Version 0.01.1c

- Smooth.h: increased speed from about 400 us to between 1-5 us, depending on
number type, by changing floating to fixed point in internal calculations. Types
are now restricted to char, unsigned char, int and unsigned int.
- mozzi_fixmath.h: changed *_float2fix names to float_to* , added some types and fixed some mistakes
- mozzi_utils.h:
	-hardcoded midiToFreq[] array to progmem instead of generating on startup
	-removed old Q16n16_mtof() and renamed Q16n16_mtofLookup() to Q16n16_mtof().
	The old Q16n16_mtof() was slower and less accurate than the lookup version.
- fixed example _08_Detuned_Beats_Wash to work with new midi, fixed-point and Oscil setFreq_Q16n16 code.


Version 0.01.1b

- Oscil.h:
	- added a setPhase() method to play a table from any position.
	- added setFreq_Q16n16() for setting frequency using Q16n16 fixed-point numbers
- _09_PhaseMod_Envelope example wasn't showing up in Arduino, fixed the name so it can be found.
- added triangle, saw and cos tables in sizes 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096 and 8192
- added a float2mozzi_uint8.py, renamed the other wave converter scripts and made them more uniform
- mozzi_utils.h/utils.cpp:
	- added Q16n16_mtofLookup(), a fast (but less accurate for non-integer midi note numbers) fixed point alternative to mtof().
	- added Q16n16_mtof(), a faster (but less accurate overall) fixed point alternative to mtof().
	- changed setupFastADC() to setupFastAnalogRead()
- replaced TABLE_NUM_CELLS with NUM_CELLS in tables


Version 0.01.1

- Changed utils.c to utils.cpp and changed all examples from #include utils.c to #include mozzi_utils.h.
- Changed and capitalised names in saw_analogue512_int8.h
- Removed some wavetables which were too short. (should make more 1024 & 2048 tables)
- Oscil.h and Sample.h, added a constructor for declaring without a table, and a setTable() method, prompted by "konsumer' on mozzi-users
