/** @ingroup sensortools
 	Enables the resolution of analog inputs to be increased by oversampling and decimation.
 	Noise should be added to the input before it's digitised, then a succession of input readings are summed and 
 	finally divided to give a number with greater resolution than the ADC.  
 	Often, noise in the Arduino system will be enough, but there are other practical methods described in 
 	[Enhancing ADC Resolution by Oversampling](http://www.atmel.com/images/doc8003.pdfâ€Ž),
 	as well as an explanation of the overall approach.
 	@tparam RESOLUTION_INCREASE_BITS how many extra bits of resolution to produce.
	The window length and the memory it needs increases quickly as the oversampling resolution increases.  
	1 bit = 4 unsigned ints (analog input between 0-1023) = 8 uint8_ts,
	2 bits = 16 unsigned ints = 32 uint8_ts,  
	3 bits = 64 unsigned ints = 128 uint8_ts,
	More than 3 bits increase in resolution would require either using longs to store the readings,
	which would need 1024 uint8_ts for a 4 bit increase and 4096 uint8_ts for 5 bits (do any avr's have that much room?),
	or the average reading would have to be no more than 128 (for 4 bits increase), because 256 readings would be needed,
	and the sum of all 256 readings would have to fit into an int.  (32767 / 256 = 128).
	Changing OverSample to use unsigned ints could enable an average reading of 256, but isn't tested properly yet.
	@note The higher the resolution, the more lag there will be.
	It's almost a RollingAverage filter, with the difference that 
	OverSample doesn't divide by as much as you would for an average.
