Porting to Mozzi 2.0

// TODO: properly type up


changed config names and semantics TODO (incomplete)

audio modes mapping

 - STANDARD: MOZZI_OUTPUT_PWM with PWM_RATE == AUDIO_RATE
 - STANDARD_PLUS: MOZZI_OUTPUT_PWM with PWM_RATE == 32768
 - HIFI: MOZZI_OUTPUT_2PIN_PWM
 - EXTERNAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT (without BYPASS_MOZZI_BUFFER): MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_TIMED
 - EXTERNAL_AUDIO_OUTPUT (with BYPASS_MOZZI_BUFFER): MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_CUSTOM 
 
further
 - USE_AUDIO_INPUT: MOZZI_AUDIO_INPUT

simple renames:
 - AUDIO_RATE: MOZZI_AUDIO_RATE
 - CONTROL_RATE: MOZZI_CONTROL_RATE

all new
 - MOZZI_ANALOG_READS -> allows to disable, explicitly
 - MOZZI_COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL

general:
 - Added many config sanity checks. Some may be too strict, if so please mention

 Other removed stuff:
 - pauseMozzi() - was still declared but not defined -> not usable, anyway
 - unpauseMozzi() - was still declared but not defined -> not usable, anyway



Documentation bits that still need to find a new home (many other bits were moved around, many, many duplicates merged into a common place, and seom obsoleted bits discarded):

Contrary to earlier versions of Mozzi, this version does not take over Timer 0, and thus Arduino
functions delay(), millis(), micros() and delayMicroseconds() remain usable in theory. That said,
you should avoid these functions, as they are slow (or even blocking). For measuring time, refer
to mozziMircos(). For delaying events, you can use Mozzi's EventDelay() unit instead
(not to be confused with AudioDelay()).
