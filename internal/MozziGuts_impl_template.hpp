/** README! 
 * This file is meant to be used as a template when adding support for a new platform. Please read these instructions, first.
 *
 *  Files involved:
 *  1. Modify hardware_defines.h, adding a macro to detect your target platform
 *  2. Modify MozziGuts.cpp to include MozziGuts_impl_YOURPLATFORM.hpp
 *  3. Modify internal/config_checks_generic.h to include internal/config_checks_YOURPLATFORM.h
 *  4. Copy this file to MozziGuts_impl_YOURPLATFORM.hpp and adjust as necessary, same for internal/config_checks_template.h
 *  (If your platform is very similar to an existing port, it may instead be better to modify the existing MozziGuts_impl_XYZ.hpp/config_checks_XYZ.h,
 *  instead of steps 2-3.).
 *  Some platforms may need small modifications to other files as well, e.g. mozzi_pgmspace.h
 *
 *  How to implement MozziGuts_impl_YOURPLATFORM.hpp:
 *  - Follow the NOTEs provided in this file
 *  - Read the doc at the top of AudioOutput.h for a better understanding of the basic audio output framework
 *  - Take a peek at existing implementations for other hardware (e.g. TEENSY3/4 is rather complete while also simple at the time of this writing)
 *  - Wait for more documentation to arrive
 *  - Ask when in doubt
 *  - Don't forget to provide a PR when done (it does not have to be perfect; e.g. many ports skip analog input, initially)

// In order to allow simple yet efficient user configuration, the entire contents of this file are compiled in the same translation unit
// as (the main file of) the user sketch. To avoid name clashes, we encapsulate everyghing in a namespace.
// For the most part, this namescape can just extend from the start of the file to the end (as shown, here), and you will not have to
// worry about it. However, there may be a few situations, where you have to "leave" the MozziPrivate namespace. This includes:
// - When you include a further (hardware-dependent library). Consider gathering all includes at the top of this file, instead.
// - When you provide definitions for special names, importantly for ISR-functions. If these would be placed in the namespace, the linker would not
//   recognize them as the definition of the intended ISR-vector. See MozziGuts_impl_AVR.hpp for examples.

 * in your platform configuration checks:

 * // analog reads shall be enabled by default on platforms that support it 
 * #if not defined(MOZZI_ANALOG_READ)

/** NOTE: On "pins" vs. "channels" vs. "indices"
 *  "Pin" is the pin number as would usually be specified by the user in mozziAnalogRead().
 *  "Channel" is an internal ADC channel number corresponding to that pin. On many platforms this is simply the same as the pin number, on others it differs.
 *      In other words, this is an internal representation of "pin".
 *  "Index" is the index of the reading for a certain pin/channel in the array of analog_readings, ranging from 0 to NUM_ANALOG_PINS. This, again may be the
 *      same as "channel" (e.g. on AVR), however, on platforms where ADC-capable "channels" are not numbered sequentially starting from 0, the channel needs
 *      to be converted to a suitable index.
 *
 *  In summary, the semantics are roughly
 *      mozziAnalogRead(pin) -> _ADCimplementation_(channel) -> analog_readings[index]
 *  Implement adcPinToChannelNum() and channelNumToIndex() to perform the appropriate mapping.
