[Anatomy of a Mozzi sketch](a-simple-sketch/)  
A detailed introduction to the parts of a Mozzi sketch, showing how to use an oscillator to generate audio and control signals.

[Output Circuits](output/)  
Shows how to connect Mozzi for audio output, including a schematic for 2-pin PWM ("HIFI") mode using only 3 components, and a filter for reducing carrier frequency noise which some people can hear in the regular PWM modes.

[Hints and Tips](hints/)  
What kind of code Mozzi likes best, debugging and monitoring your sketches.

[Under the Hood](under-the-hood/)  
Outlines how Mozzi works behind the scenes.
