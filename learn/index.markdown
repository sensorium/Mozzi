[Mozzi, an Introductory Tutorial](introductory-tutorial/)  
This shows how to set up an Arduino with Mozzi from scratch and use analog inputs to make sounds using a knob, light sensing, pressure, and a switch (on a digital input).

[Anatomy of a Mozzi sketch](a-simple-sketch/)  
A detailed introduction to the parts of a Mozzi sketch, showing how to use an oscillator to generate audio and control signals.

[Output Modes](output/)  
Where to connect your audio hardware to your MCU, and the different mode available for high quality sound output.

[Output Circuits](output_circuits/)  
Hardware filtering of undesired frequencies (carrier frequency noise which some people can hear in the regular PWM modes), and amplification circuits.

[Configuring Mozzi](configuration/)  
So you've read about all these available configuration options, but just how to use them?

[Porting old sketches to a new Mozzi](porting/)  
Your old sketch no longer compiles, or only with a bunch of warnings? Usually only some very minor adjustments are needed. See this guide for what may have to be changed.

[Hints and Tips](hints/)  
What kind of code Mozzi likes best, debugging and monitoring your sketches.

[Under the Hood](under-the-hood/)  
Outlines how Mozzi works behind the scenes.
