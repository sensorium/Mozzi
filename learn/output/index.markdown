# Mozzi output modes - from simple to HIFI

When Mozzi came to life around 2012 the world was simple: Only one CPU family was supported, and only a single output mode. That quickly grew to several different output options,
and today Mozzi runs on a wide variety of different MCUs with very different hardware capabilities.  

The table at the bottom of the page provides an overview what modes are supported on which board, and importantly, what pin(s) to expect audio output on. This may
look quite confusing on first glance, but actually, in a default configuration, output is always sent to a single pin in the form of a direct (emulated) analog
signal. We'll look at that scenario first, and it is also very much recommended to stick to the default mode, at first.

## Single pin output modes

Here, "single pin" means one output pin *per audio channel*, so it could also be two pins for stereo output.

### Output using a true hardware DAC

Things are easy, if your MCU comes with a true hardware DAC, which outputs a true analog signal. This corresponds to the "DAC" column in the table
below, and the configuration option ```MOZZI_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_DAC```.
Boards that fall into this category include Teensy 3.1, Arduino Giga, and ESP32. Note however, that for the latter two, the output resolution is only 8 bits.

When using this modes, all you need to worry about is whether the output is capable
of providing enough output current. I.e. you may need to follow up with a generic amplifier circuit to drive low impedance speakers, but that's it.

### Modulated output (PWM or PDM)

Most boards do not feature a hardware DAC, however. In this case, an analog signal needs to be emulated by quickly toggling a digital pin high or low.
This can either happen using so-called pusle width modulation (```MOZZI_OUTPUT_PWM```) or pulse density modulation (```MOZZI_OUTPUT_PDM_VIA_I2S``` or (```MOZZI_OUTPUT_PDM_VIA_SERIAL```). We're not going into detail, here, but it should be noted that in both cases there is a trade-off between the
granularity of the output voltages (i.e. how may different voltage levels can be emulated between logical high and logical low, and the speed at which
these values can be emulated (the carrier frequency).

Simply put, using pulse width modulation (PWM), if you want 12 bits of output resolution, i.e. 4096 distrinc signal levels, a digital output
pin will have to be held high (or low) for up to that many CPU cycles, so this will generally require a clock on the order of at least 100 Mhz
in oder to push the carrier frequency outside the audible range. See configuration options `MOZZI_PWM_RATE`, and `MOZZI_AUDIO_BITS`,
or `MOZZI_PDM_RESOLUTION` if you want to tweak this tradeoff.
{: .notice--info}

In some configurations, you (or your kids/pets, how can perceive high frequncies much better), may notice a high-pitch noise, at the carrier frequency.
Using a higher carrier frequency - if possible - may mitigate this to some degree. See the [API documentation](/Mozzi/doc/html/group__hardware.html) for details
on what you can tweak. However, for best quality it will often make sense to add a low-pass filter, which may be as easy as adding a capacitor and a resistor.
See the [output circuis](../output/) page for details.

## Output circuit for 2-pin-PWM ("HIFI") mode

Mozzi's ```MOZZI_OUTPUT_2PIN_PWM``` (formerly known as "HIFI") audio mode combines the output of 2 pins in a technique called dual PWM, which is explained in detail at [Open Music Labs](https://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/pwm-dac/dual-pwm-circuits/).

This output mode needs a differnt and more complex output circuitry than the single pin modes, and using the regular single pin circuit for "HIFI" will result in
terribly distorted sound. In case of difficiculties (but also in general), it is very much recommended to try the default output mode, first, and switch to any
other mode only once you've verified that works. Don't go straight for "HIFI" just because is sounds promising.

Here's the circuit for Mozzi, based on the Open Music Labs article.

Not all boards support the 2-pin PWM mode, but some are capable of quite good output resolution in their default mode.

### Low-pass filtering
The dual PWM mode, too, can profit from a [hardware filter](../output/) attenuating the carrier frequency. In 2-pin PWM mode, the filter
would be applied on the combined audio output signal rather than straight from pin 9 in single pin mode.

### Advantages of HIFI mode
- Higher resolution sound than single pin PWM modes.  
- Generally doesn't need a notch filter on the audio signal because the carrier frequency is out of hearing range.

### Disadvantages
- Requires 2 pins, 2 resistors and a capacitor, so it's not so quick to set up compared to a rough, direct single-pin output in default mode.

## Output to external DACs (or custom circuitry)

### Native (I2S) DAC interface

On a few platforms (including ESP8266 and ESP32), Mozzi has inbuilt support for interfacing with certain DAC ICs using the I2S interface. This interface
uses (usually) three pins to transmit audio samples in a digial format:
 - a bit clock line, usually labelled SCK or BCLK
 - a word clock line, usually labelled WS or LRCLK
 - a data line, often labelled SD, SDATA, SDIN, SDOUT, DACDAT, or similar
 - (some variants may include additional pins, but these do not seem common on MCUs, at the time of this writing)

The pins used for these lines may or may not be configurable, depending on your hardware. See the [API documentation](/Mozzi/doc/html/group__hardware.html) for details.

Unfortunately, the I2S format comes in several variants, and feeding a DAC data in the wrong format will lead to terribly distorted sound. Again,
refer to the [API documentation](/Mozzi/doc/html/group__hardware.html) for configuration options, and/or make sure to use a DAC chip that is known to be supported.

### Custom interface to external DACs or other hardware

On all platforms, you can provide custom output routines, which allow you to output to anything from hand-made resistor ladders over purchased dedicated DAC ICs to
a bluetooth audio sink. To enable this, take a look at the configuration options `MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_TIMED` and `MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_CUSTOM` (see [API documentation](/Mozzi/doc/html/group__hardware.html)).
Mozzi also ships with a whole section of examples for connecting to external components, including MCP4922 and PT8211 DACs (File->Examples->Mozzi->13.External_Audio_Output).

The basic procedure for using the two external output modes is this:

```
// before including Mozzi.h, configure external audio output mode:
#include "MozziConfigValues.h"                        // for named option values
#define MOZZI_AUDIO_MODE MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_TIMED  // configure external mode
#include <Mozzi.h>

// [most of your sketch is as usual]

// additionally provide this function.
void audioOutput(const AudioOutput f) {
  // put here code to output the sample encapsulated by the structure f:
  // This holds either one (mono) or two (stereo) channels, which can be
  // obtained using f.l() and f.r().
  // Each contains a zero-centered integer value scaled to MOZZI_AUDIO_BITS resolution

  // e.g.:
  myDAC.write(f.l() + MOZZI_AUDIO_BIAS, f.r() + MOZZI_AUDIO_BIAS);
}
```

The ```audioOutput()``` function in the above example will now be called at ```MOZZI_AUDIO_RATE```. In some cases, however, it will be preferrable to delegate the rate
control elsewhere. For instance, maybe you have a library that will feed an external DAC via a hardware DMA mechanism. For such a case set the output mode to
```MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_CUSTOM``` and provide an additional function ```canBufferAudioOutput()``` which should return true whenever another sample should be generated:

```
#include "MozziConfigValues.h"
#define MOZZI_AUDIO_MODE MOZZI_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_CUSTOM
#include <Mozzi.h>

void audioOutput(const AudioOutput f) {
  // e.g.:
  myDAC.write(f.l() + MOZZI_AUDIO_BIAS, f.r() + MOZZI_AUDIO_BIAS);
}

bool canBufferAudioOutput() {
  return (!myDAC.bufferFull());
}
```
