This is automatically called in startMozzi.
It makes mozziAnalogRead() happen faster than the standard Arduino analogRead(), changing the
duration from about 105 in unmodified Arduino to about 16 microseconds for a
dependable read with the default speed parameter FAST_ADC.
If you want to set on of the faster modes (see params) you can call this after startMozzi().
See: http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1208715493/11, and
http://www.marulaberry.co.za/index.php/tutorials/code/arduino-adc/
@param speed FAST_ADC, FASTER_ADC or FASTEST_ADC. If no parameter is supplied, the
default is FAST_ADC, which sets the analog conversion clock predivide rate to
16, giving 1Mhz on a 16MHz board, the fastest rate for which behaviour is
defined (~16us per sample). However, divisors of 8 and 4 also show usable
results in the graphs in this paper:
http://dam.mellis.org/Mellis%20-%20Sensor%20Library%20for%20Arduino%20-%20Paper.pdf,
so you can also try FASTER_ADC or FASTEST_ADC for divide rates of 8 or 4, giving
times of about 8us or 4us per sample. Beware, reliable results will depend on
the sort of input signal you have. Only use FASTER_ADC or FASTEST_ADC if you
know what you're doing.

/**  @ingroup analog
Prepare an analog input channel by turning off its digital input buffer.
This helps to reduce noise, increase analog reading speed, and save power.

Here's more detail from http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/atmega-adc/:

The DIDR (Data Input Disable Register) disconnects the digital inputs from
whichever ADC channels you are using. This is important for 2 reasons. First
off, an analog input will be floating all over the place, and causing the
digital input to constantly toggle high and low. This creates excessive noise
near the ADC, and burns extra power. Secondly, the digital input and associated
DIDR switch have a capacitance associated with them which will slow down your
input signal if you are sampling a highly resistive load.

And from the ATmega328p datasheet, p266:

When an analog signal is applied to the ADC pin and the digital input from
this pin is not needed, this bit should be written logic one to reduce power
consumption in the digital input buffer. Note that ADC named_pins ADC7 
and ADC6 do not have digital input buffers, and therefore do not require 
Digital Input Disable bits.
@param channel_num the analog input channel you wish to use.

Starts an analog to digital conversion of the voltage on a specified channel.  Unlike
Arduino's analogRead() function which waits until a conversion is complete before
returning, adcStartConversion() only sets the conversion to begin, so you can use

/** @ingroup analog
Reads the analog input of a chosen channel, without blocking other operations from running.
It actually returns the most recent analog reading and puts the chosen pin or channel
on the stack of channels to be read in the background before the next control
interrupt.

@note Analog reads have different hardware resolution on different platforms. E.g. an analog read
      on an Arduino Uno R3 will return a value in the range 0-1023 (10 bits), on a Raspberry Pi Pico
      it will return 0-4095 (12 bits). For portable code, it is thus necessary to specify the desired
      resolution of reads. This can be done by setting MOZZI_ANALOG_READ_RESOLUTION to the resolution
      in bits, near the top of your sketch. All reads will then be adjusted to that range, automatically
      (using a simple bit-shift). Alternatively, the templated version of mozziAanalogRead() allows
      to specifiy the target resolution per read.
      If MOZZI_ANALOG_READ_RESOLUTION is not defined, this (non-templated) function returns a value
      in the default hardware resolution, with a warning.

@param pin_or_channel the analog pin or channel number.
@return the digitised value of the voltage on the chosen channel. See the note above regarding the output range!
