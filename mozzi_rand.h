Initialises Mozzi's (pseudo)random number generator xorshift96(), which is used

be different on each run of a sketch, by seeding with fairly random input, such
as analogRead() on an unconnected pin (as explained in the Arduino documentation
for randomSeed(). randSeed is the same as xorshift96Seed(), but easier to
remember.

randSeed() called without a parameter uses noise from reading the Arduino's
internal temperature as the seed, a technique discussed at
http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,38091.0.html, borrowing code put there
by Rob Tillaart.

@note Intialization of the random seed is done differently on different MCUs,
      but is nowhere near perfect for most (and for some it is not even implemented at all).
      Many implementations (e.g. on AVR, STM32) simply rely on reading a (hopefully noisy)
      internal temperature sensor.
      You will often get better results by calling analogRead() - @em not mozziAnalogRead(0), in this case! -
      on one or two floating (non-connected) analog pins.
